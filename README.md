# PacMen
## Week 7 Module

### Description
In this project, we implement HTML, CSS, and Javascript to generate a PacMan image and have it move in both X and Y directions within the window.
<br>
<br>

### How To
1. Click "Add PacMan" to generate any number of PacMan images
2. Click "Start Game" to move the PacMan image(s)
3. You may click "Add PacMan" at any point in time to create more PacMan images

### Future Outlook
This project will most likely be revisited to test generating different variations of PacMan, including colors, sizes, and orientations.
